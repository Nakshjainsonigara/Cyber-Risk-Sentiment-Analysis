My thoughts on a decade of Cyber Security: 10 Lessons I’ve learned,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/p9fo4d/my_thoughts_on_a_decade_of_cyber_security_10/,"I’ve spent a little more than a decade working in cyber starting with fixing computers at my local pizza joint all the way to leading a security operations center (SOC) for a multibillion-dollar enterprise with thousands of users and hundreds of thousands of machines. Here’s ten lessons I’ve learned along the way.

&#x200B;

## 1. Cyber is risk and nothing else

It’s important to understand that businesses think in terms of money and risk. If the potential money gain outweighs the risk of money loss, then that idea is likely to go forward; however, the opposite is also true. If something is more likely to lose money, then that idea is likely to get stopped. Cyber security falls squarely in the latter category.

Businesses are constantly looking at what is costing them money and what’s bringing in money. Cyber security is a money pit. Money gets poured into cyber security, but it does not make any profit. Some companies have gotten better about understanding how reliant their business is on cyber, especially in the COVID era where online shopping is the safest way to shop but understanding reliance on cyber does not translate to understanding reliance on security.

A CFO once asked why we spend so much money on antivirus when the company hasn’t had a virus outbreak in 5 years. This question struck me because the answer seemed so obvious; we haven’t had a virus outbreak because we have antivirus. But to the CFO who’s only looking at dollar this seemed pointless. Why spend hundreds of thousands a year to put AV on every desktop when we haven’t had a virus in years. He was thinking reactive, and I was thinking proactive.

This shift in mentality is where I see a lot of room for improvement in traditional SOCs. We need to learn to speak like a finance officer. We need to be able to explain to them how proper cyber security enables their money-making activities.

Going back to my antivirus example I learned that I needed to speak the language of finance, I needed to speak in terms of money.

## 2. No one cares about your stats

This is a direct continuation of the previous point but it’s important enough to list on its own. No one cares about your stats.

Businesses love stats and metrics. They hire teams of statisticians to make crunch numbers all day and figure out how to squeeze an extra 1% efficiency out of every sector because that extra 1% means more money. The truth is though, no one cares about your stats because your stats don’t mean anything.

When I worked as a SOC analyst monitoring firewall logs and IDS alerts I had to report metrics at the end of every shift. We reported things like how many firewall blocks happened, what our top IDS alerts where, how many, if there were any true positives, and several other menial points of data. Out of all that data there was only really one that mattered, and it only mattered to the CISO; were there any true positive IDS alerts.

The metrics we were reporting didn’t matter because they didn’t speak the universal language of business. A statistician can’t take firewall hits and translate that into saved money. We were never reporting AV blocks because it just wasn’t in our SOPs to report it. So, a CFO never saw that the AV he spent $500K a year on was blocking thirteen threats a month. Even if he did $500K for thirteen threats sounds like a lot of money for not a high return.

We must translate stats to money. When I was asked about the AV, I didn’t have a satisfactory answer because I never stopped to think like a CFO. I spent the next month trying to figure out how much an incident cost the company. I spoke with the HR department to figure out what the average pay of an Incident Responder was so I could calculate overtime pay, I spoke to finance to see how much money it cost in server downtime, I spoke to devops to figure out how long it would take to restore a server, and I spoke to the incident response team to figure out how long it took them to respond. After I crunched all the numbers, I figured out that it cost around $50K per incident.

Armed with this knowledge I looked at how many AV hits we had each month and found that that AV was saving the company about $650K **each month**. The CFO was shocked when he heard that number; spending $500K a year saved them almost $7.8M yearly. And that is the point about stats. No one cares how many events your firewall blocks, but they do care about how much money that saves. Learn to translate those stats into money. Don’t report just failures, report how the security apparatus is working and how much money it’s saving the company on average.

## 3. Understand that not everyone is as smart as you

It should be obvious to everyone working in this profession but cyber is broad. Some people are expert malware analysts but can’t make heads from tails of a packet capture (PCAP) and consequently some people can rip a C2 beacon out of a PCAP but can’t find PowerShell usage in Window’s event logs. The point is that cyber is broad and no one is an expert in all things.

I’m not giving you carte blanche approval to be a jerk but understand that just because you’re a master with Wireshark doesn’t mean everyone else is. What may seem obvious to you may not be obvious to someone else. Understand that your peers may not have the same knowledge, experience, or analytical reasoning that you do; and by extension you don’t have the same that they do.

You may need to take time to explain your thought process to others. It’s not an insult of your intelligence when someone asks you to explain your reasoning. It’s far more likely that this is something new to them. At the same time, it’s not incompetence to ask others to explain their reasoning because you don’t understand. I’ve had to explain my thought process on multiple occasions when I open an incident, and in almost every one of those occasions it was simply because someone else didn’t see the same indicators in the traffic that I did. After a quick explanation we agreed on opening an incident.

People are human, they miss things. We all miss things. Don’t be an a\*\* when someone asks you to explain your reasoning.

## 4. Stop with the playbooks

Playbooks are good, but too many playbooks are a hinderance. It’s important to have some playbooks for standard things; what do you do if ransomware happens? What happens if you get malware on the network? What do you do if there’s a breach of a critical service?

I mention this because I have worked in multiple places that tried to either create too many playbooks or wanted extremely specific playbooks. One office I worked in wanted a playbook for every variant of ransomware. How do we respond to Locky Ransomware? What about for NotPetya? WannaCry?

We also had playbooks for botnets, malware, cryptominers, etc. Every new family of malware needed a new playbook. We spent so much time making playbooks every time we had an infection that we probably missed more than we found. None of these playbooks were properly indexed of course, so whenever we had an investigation, we had to hunt through shared drives and folders until we found the appropriate playbook so we could follow the “approved” process for dealing with it. Was Dridex in the botnet folder or the banking folder under malware? Wait it’s in both? Which one is more updated?

On the opposite side of the house, I’ve had some bosses who wanted playbooks so specific that we hardly had anything usable. This playbook can only be used when the Dridex malware infects exactly three computers all on the same VLAN and communicating with a C2 server in China. Playbooks like this were worthless because they were never used since the criteria were almost never met.

Playbooks are good, but they need to be at the appropriate level.

## 5. Read the news for your boss

Don’t read the news to your boss, read it for your boss. I can’t even begin to count the number of times I’ve had my boss ask me about some ridiculous thing they read about on CNN or Wired.

When the Pulse Secure VPN exploit made major news with a CVSS score of 10 I got the distinct pleasure of answer a barrage of questions about what we’re doing about this. My answer was simple; nothing. We’re doing nothing because we don’t have Pulse Secure VPNs on our network.

We should never be caught off guard by things that show up in the popular news outlets. You can be forgiven for not knowing about something that appeared on an obscure Twitter post, but if something gains enough steam to be reported on by a major mainstream news outlet then you should know about it before your boss.

Telling your boss that you don’t know about something that hit mainstream news hurts your credibility as a professional, but more than that it can lead to extra work for you and your team. I’ve been involved in incident response operations that kicked off because someone’s boss read an article on CNN and wanted answers. When his SOC team lead couldn’t speak on the matter the CISO tasked the incident response team to investigate.

We could have, and did, tell the CISO and the SOC that we weren’t vulnerable to what they read about but the gears were already in motion, and everyone was wound up, so we went out to respond to a threat that didn’t exist in the first place.

## 6. Blackhat is mostly pointless

I’m going to make a lot of people mad here, but I passionately believe that conferences like Blackhat cause more issues than they solve for those of us in the cyber trenches. Blackhat, Defcon, RSA Con, Threat Intelligence Summit, etc. are good for introducing the world at large to up and coming threats to unique components but for the vast majority of SOCs it doesn’t matter.

I’ve said for a long time that the things you were concerned about before Blackhat are probably the things you should still be concerned about after Blackhat. If you’re a traditional IT network most of what gets talked about probably won’t apply to you. Even if it does apply to you, it’s important to understand the level at which it applies to you.

Look at the concept of Google’s Row hammer exploit. When it was introduced, it made major news because of the potential it had on Cloud Virtual Private Server (VPS) providers. A threat actor could exploit a vulnerable virtual machine (VM) to manipulate the memory of the physical server to extract data from a different VM on the same physical VPS. This concept made major headlines but when tested by Microsoft it was determined that it was exceptionally difficult and generated sub optimal row activation sequences.

Even though this was technically feasible and potentially devastating it was something not worth worrying about unless you’re dealing with data of National Security. A Blackhat conference may disclose a way to exfil data out of a VM at 1Kbps but is that something you should worry about? At that speeds an attacker might get a single word document in about a week.

What you were concerned about before Blackhat is what you should still be concerned about after Blackhat.

## 7. Location, Location, Location

One of the most challenge concepts new SOC analysts seem to deal with isn’t investigating new malware strains; its understanding the location of our sensors and what they can provide.

In your enterprise right now, there are a lot of logs, if your System Information and Event Management (SIEM) is set up correctly you probably won’t see all the diverse ways logs come to you, but you probably have several. IDS logs, Firewall logs, DNS logs, proxy logs, IPS alerts (if separate from IDS), Window’s event logs, Domain Controller logs, Linux server logs, antivirus logs, and more. Not every source of logs shows the same type or amount of data.

In my anecdotal experience one of the most difficult things for SOC analysts to learn is where to look for distinct types of information. SIEMs help correlate all these logs to give analysts an easier way to move between them, but a good analyst still understands what sensor collects what and how to move between sensors in an investigation.

Let’s say that you see a connection to a known bad IP address. Depending on the location of the sensor you might have more or less information. You might need to query other sensors for what you want.

When I first started working in a SOC we didn’t have full log ingesting in our SIEM. The SIEM got firewall logs, but we also had an IDS outside the firewall and different subnets had their own edge routers (yes it was a double NAT) with their own IDS behind the router. Depending on where you looked you might not see the actual host IP address as everything would be behind a NAT.

I’ve also been asked to consult on the location of new sensors to help fill in some gaps we had. Before I could answer that I needed to know where we already had sensors and what they could see.

## 8. You’re probably doing threat intelligence wrong

This one is going to be a hot take, but you’re probably doing Cyber Threat Intelligence Wrong. Looking up IP addresses in VirusTotal is not threat intelligence. Same with domains and file hashes. Your SIEM should be automatically enriching your data with this type of information. Reading reports and checking twitter for IOCs to plug into your SIEM because your CFO doesn’t want to pay for Crowstrike’s premium addon also isn’t Threat Intelligence. True threat intelligence is a nebulous concept, but I’ll try to provide my take on it.

My first job working in a SOC was in the threat intelligence section. My job was to read reporting grab IOCs (mainly IPs, domains, and Hashes) then search them in the SIEM to see if we had and connections. The job was frankly a waste of time. Using a feed to enrich our Splunk data quickly made my job obsolete as everything I was doing became automated.

During my time doing threat intelligence I asked our incident response team how often they used threat intelligence in their operations. The response was a resounding **never**. In fact, one of the responders even went as far as to say that Intelligence actively hurt one of their ops.

I spent some time thinking about what type of intelligence they would need. Your intelligence team needs to understand what the critical business assets are, what the vulnerabilities are around those critical assets, what capabilities exist against those vulnerabilities, and what sensors are in place to detect them. Threat intelligence should read about how attackers conduct campaigns, map that to the MITRE ATT&CK matrix, and then overlay the content they can detect. Using all of this we can create predictive intelligence to help incident response find previously unknown compromises.

## 9. Don’t write to be understood, write so that you can’t possibly be misunderstood.

Report writing is something we’re all going to have to do at some point. Far too frequently we write assuming the people reading our reports has the same level of knowledge that we do, except that’s not always true.

My team wrote reports that went all the way up to the CEO. And we rewrote the report when the CEO had no idea what we were talking about. Years ago, when I was a just a threat analyst I wrote a report about indications of a worm on the network, only I never mentioned a worm. I forget what the report actually said but I remember getting into a heated discussion with my boss the wording.

She read the report and told me flatly that she didn’t see any threat. I was aghast because I thought it was plainly obvious where the threat was, but she didn’t get it. I explained that this was indications of a worm and she told me now she understood but if this reached the C-Suite folks they wouldn’t get it. I was an arrogant young analyst and replied that it wasn’t meant for them, so it didn’t matter if they understood it.

Much like my third point in this post I didn’t consider the fact that others who want to know might not be able to understand what I’m saying. I wrote my report to be understood by a very small subset of people.

Writing to not be misunderstood also means writing clearly using established terms, frameworks, and a common lexicon. How many times have you heard people refer to the Eternal Blue vulnerability? Eternal Blue was an exploit, the vulnerability was CVE MS17-010. It’s important when we’re writing to be specific and accurate because you never know who will be reading it.

## 10. Make friends with your Marketing team

When I first started my career in Cyber Security, I held the, unfortunately normal, believe that art degrees didn’t belong in Cyber Security. Don’t pollute my science with your art; boy was I wrong.

Art absolutely has a place in the realm of cyber security and marketing can be a major ally for you when you’re trying to convince leadership of something.

One day I was trying to explain to my boss how a malware campaign was propagating through our network and why we needed to take certain actions to stop it. She didn’t understand what I was trying to convey. We gave her our 23-page report on the malware which included lots of granular detail and screenshots of hex code, PCAP, C code, and log files. To this day I’m convinced she never read it because it was far too long. She wouldn’t advocate for our suggestions because she didn’t understand what we were suggesting.

I was trying to figure out how I could get my message across, I consider my public speak skills to be above average so if I couldn’t convince her with a presentation then I needed something else. My team was brainstorming and eventually someone said, “what about an image?”. We all agreed that an image was worth a shot but none of us were graphic designers, so we were ready to write that idea off or try to make something with PowerPoint when I had the idea of asking an actual graphic designer.

I went over to marketing and explained the situation to their team lead. He listened for a while and then took me over to see their graphics design team. I met with the graphics design folks and explained the situation again when an absolute gem of a human said she would. What followed was three days of back-and-forth communication as she would desperately try to understand what we were saying and translate that into an image. At the end of the three days, she had created a single image masterpiece that clearly illustrated the points we were trying to get across to leadership.

Art and marketing absolutely have a place in cyber security. When you think about it from a business perspective, I was trying to market my positions to my boss, and who is better at marketing a position then the team who is made specifically to market products?

If you look at major threat intelligence companies like Talos or the Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) you might notice that most of their reports also have some clear graphics to go with them. A well-designed image can convey the same information as a 23-page report.

Trying to break into Cybersecurity? Stop being picky.,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/14o767n/trying_to_break_into_cybersecurity_stop_being/,"I went from zero IT experience on my resume, to landing my first job in cybersecurity, to 6 months later landing a new job doing the same role for 50% more salary. I’m not special and anyone can do this. 

To elaborate on the title… I have witnessed too many fiends trying to break into the industry being too picky about their presumptive roles. “It just HAS to be remote work only.” “I won’t work somewhere where I have to work on the weekend at all.” “I have to make X amount of money.” 

I get it and I feel the same way kinda. I know I’m worth something, but these employers have no reference for me in this industry. 

My BIGGEST advice for everyone out there… TAKE THE FIRST CYBERSECURITY ROLE YOU CAN LAND. That’s it! That’ll pave your way. 

I was shocked by how quickly (like 3 months or so) after I updated my LinkedIn with my shitty cyber role that I was getting contacted by recruiters to chat about opportunities. 

Oh but “I’ve been applying everywhere and I’ve gotten no calls backs!” Yep… I was there and finally got a call through just talking to people in the industry at a conference. Maybe you need to put yourself out there too.

But if you are truly a good hire, you can absolutely make it! Don’t get discouraged! Keep pushing. Feel free to ask me any questions.",1688249273.0,went zero experience resume landing first job cybersecurity month later landing new job role salary im special anyone elaborate title witnessed many fiend trying break industry picky presumptive role remote work wont work somewhere work weekend make x amount money get feel way kinda know im worth something employer reference industry biggest advice everyone take first cybersecurity role land thats thatll pave way shocked quickly like month updated linkedin shitty cyber role getting contacted recruiter chat opportunity oh ive applying everywhere ive gotten call back yep finally got call talking people industry conference maybe need put truly good hire absolutely make dont get discouraged keep pushing feel free ask question,0.936,Positive
To anyone considering a career in cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/137xf0d/to_anyone_considering_a_career_in_cybersecurity/,"If you're not in IT but you're considering a career in cybersecurity, whether it's because you're caught up in the buzz or genuinely interested, here's a tip: start your journey in roles like system administration, IT support, helpdesk, or anything else involving networks and servers. This is something really overlooked in the marketing/HR whatever cybersecurity hype business.

I've worked in cybersecurity for about a year and a half as a technical specialist on an auditing team. My job involves making sure our clients have all their security measures in place, from network segmentation to IAM, IDS/IPS, SIEM, and cryptography. I like the overlap with governance, and I also appreciate the opportunity to see a range of different companies and network architectures.

But if I could go back, I'd start in one of those junior roles I mentioned earlier. Cybersecurity is rooted in a solid understanding of networking, and it can be tough to get into if you don't have any prior experience. Studying the subject and earning certifications can help, of course, but nothing beats the real-world experience of working directly with a large enterprise network.

So, that's just my personal piece of advice. It's a fantastic field, and you're bound to learn heaps regardless of the path you choose. But don't get too dazzled by the glamour. Be patient, start from the basics, and work your way up. It's worth it, trust me.",1683228793.0,youre youre considering career cybersecurity whether youre caught buzz genuinely interested here tip start journey role like system administration support helpdesk anything else involving network server something really overlooked marketinghr whatever cybersecurity hype business ive worked cybersecurity year half technical specialist auditing team job involves making sure client security measure place network segmentation iam idsips siem cryptography like overlap governance also appreciate opportunity see range different company network architecture could go back id start one junior role mentioned earlier cybersecurity rooted solid understanding networking tough get dont prior experience studying subject earning certification help course nothing beat realworld experience working directly large enterprise network thats personal piece advice fantastic field youre bound learn heap regardless path choose dont get dazzled glamour patient start basic work way worth trust,0.9777,Positive

Hiring managers on this sub be like...,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/rcpzfo/hiring_managers_on_this_sub_be_like/,"Job title: Junior SOC Analyst

Seniority: entry-level 

About the role:

This is a junior, entry level role for a SOC analyst position. You will not receive any training whatsoever and we fully expect you to know our entire network and infrastructure inside and out, as well as all of our tools and internal processes, before your first day. You'll spend most of your time performing extremely complex tasks without any input or assistance from the more senior members of the team, who view your very presence as a waste of their time. 

If you do not provide an immediate ROI on our decision to hire you, you will be fired, then hogtied and thrown into the trunk of a 1987 Toyota Tercel, which will then be pushed off a cliff. The cost of the vehicle will be taken out of your paycheck and the remaining balance will be transferred to your loved ones, who will be informed of your passing by HR.

Requirements:

- MSc in CompSci or Cybersecurity (PhD. preferred)
- A+, Network+, Sec+ are all mandatory (CISSP preferred)
- minimum three years of IT experience (Sr sysadim experience preferred)
- must be willing to work non-stop, including nights and weekends, to constantly learn more skills to provide more value to the company, all without any expectation of additional compensation for yourself 
- experience speaking at conferences and industry events (BlackHat, RSAC, etc)
- you must personally know at least one member of my current team members and that person must vouche for you and swear upon their mothers grave that you will give me opportunities to ask my superiors for more money
- you must be willing to self-flagellate and beg to keep your role throughout your entire tenure, while verbally acknowledging to the senior members of your team that you are nothing, you are replaceable, you are lucky to have any job at all

Salary:

$15 / hr 

No benefits to start but we will reevaluate after one year

UGGGGHHHH there's such a skills shortage in cyber, I can't find ANY good candidates!! These millennials and zoomers are so entitled, don't they know that you need to work hard to find white collar jobs?? 

I mean, back in my day, a semester of college was the same price as a pair of jeans and multiple companies would offer you a job with a salary that could easily support a family of 4, including buying a home, paying for two cars, and putting 2 kids through college, but I know all about hard work!!1! Who do these young whippersnappers think they are?!

********

EDIT:

Glad to see that most people got the joke but to those that didnt: it's called satire. Lighten up a little.

Also, I'm happy to report that I'm fully employed and I like my job. I work for a cyber vendor so not really a technical guy (tho I do have a Sec+ thank you very much) but I feel for all the people trying to break into cyber.

It's just a little contradictory for companies to complain about a skills shortage while having unreasonable expectations for ""entry level"" roles and also not being willing to train people or help new folks get into the cyber industry.

 Like, if it's a problem for your organization, then take a look at how you're contributing to it and try to implement solutions. If it's not a problem, then stop bitching about a skills shortage and start paying for the talent you need.",1639080416.0,job title junior soc analyst seniority entrylevel role junior entry level role soc analyst position receive training whatsoever fully expect know entire network infrastructure inside well tool internal process first day youll spend time performing extremely complex task without input assistance senior member team view presence waste time provide immediate roi decision hire fired hogtied thrown trunk toyota tercel pushed cliff cost vehicle taken paycheck remaining balance transferred loved one informed passing hr requirement msc compsci cybersecurity phd preferred network sec mandatory cissp preferred minimum three year experience sr sysadim experience preferred must willing work nonstop including night weekend constantly learn skill provide value company without expectation additional compensation experience speaking conference industry event blackhat rsac etc must personally know least one member current team member person must vouche swear upon mother grave give opportunity ask superior money must willing selfflagellate beg keep role throughout entire tenure verbally acknowledging senior member team nothing replaceable lucky job salary hr benefit start reevaluate one year two week later ugggghhhh there skill shortage cyber cant find good candidate millennials zoomers entitled dont know need work hard find white collar job mean back day semester college price pair jean multiple company would offer job salary could easily support family including buying home paying two car putting kid college know hard work young whippersnapper think edit glad see people got joke didnt called satire lighten little also im happy report im fully employed like job work cyber vendor really technical guy tho sec thank much feel people trying break cyber little contradictory company complain skill shortage unreasonable expectation entry level role also willing train people help new folk get cyber industry like problem organization take look youre contributing try implement solution problem stop bitching skill shortage start paying talent need,0.9424,Positive
"I am a reformed convicted computer hacker that caused over £70,000,000 in damage. AMA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/ohllk8/i_am_a_reformed_convicted_computer_hacker_that/,"I am a reformed convicted computer hacker who was sentenced at the Central Criminal Court (Old Bailey) and spent time in HMP Belmarsh (high security) for causing over £70,000,000 in damage 

In 2015, I was arrested, released on bail for 4 years, and sentenced in 2019 to 4 years in prison. The majority of my offences did not require extensive technical knowledge and were committed through easily identifiable web application vulnerabilities.

I was apprehended because I was an idiot. At the time, I didn't care or even consider the possibility of the consequences of what I was doing. Despite using Tor, I did not adequately obfuscate transactions and reused Bitcoin addresses when making ransom demands. As a result, many of my offences were linked, providing the authorities with a larger surface to work with.

I spent two years in a prison cell for 23 hours per day and my honest opinion is that freedom is far more significant than anything that you will obtain from criminality. If you're not willing to commit to a lifestyle of criminality, then don't do it.

I believe that I am reformed because this experience has truly changed my perspective on life in general. While I was on bail, I engaged extensively in vulnerability disclosure using the responsible disclosure model and I have since reported vulnerabilities (P1 - P3) to the Crown Court Digital Case System (CCDCS), the National Crime Agency (NCA), the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), Parliament, the University of Cambridge, Deutsche Bank, the Australian National University, Stanford University, ESET, Yahoo, Royal Airforce (MOD), GCHQ, TD Bank, DBS Bank, AT&T, Esri, the BBC, Sony, Deutsche Telekom, the United Nations, Duke University, Adobe, AOL, Telegram, Sage, Amazon, Virgin Media, Houzz, NOAA, BT, University of Wales, BMW, Lamborghini, Financial Times, Europa, Jaguar, Harvey Nichols, Hugo Boss, Admiral, MIT University, Europa, HSBC, Chanel, Bank of Melbourne, the Royal Bank of Canada, Huawei, the Ministry of Defence, Swedbank, NHS, Telegraph, VICE, NASA, MSI, Costco, Gucci, ESPN, GumTree, Asos, Harvard University, Booking, CBC, Sandisk, Yahoo, Rambler, Acer, OVH, UK Fast, Independent, Telstra, University of Oxford, HP, Barclays, Litecoin, Aerohive Networks, and hundreds more over a 4 year period.

Please keep in mind that I will not respond to questions about criminal activity. Please don't think I'm ignoring you, I'm not here to promote or advocate criminality. The purpose of this post is to inform others about my experience and share insight so that they can make their own decisions.

"From June 12th-14th, r/cybersecurity will go private to protest Reddit's API changes & killing 3rd party apps",https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/141h6o0/from_june_12th14th_rcybersecurity_will_go_private/,"Hi all, reviewing the feedback we received on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/13z5vbj/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/) and via modmail, the vast majority of this community wants Reddit to undo or modify its recent decision to kill 3rd party applications and place restrictions on the API.

So unless Reddit walks back their recent API changes, r/cybersecurity will join the blackout for 48h, starting June 12th and ending on the 14th. If Reddit doesn't back down, we'll ask what y'all want to do (extend the protest, do something else, etc.) - it's the community's call.

For the blackout period, this means the subreddit will be inaccessible to new members or unauthenticated users. In addition, you are strongly encouraged to not visit Reddit during the blackout. If you have ideas for what this community should do - if anything - during the blackout please comment below (ex. restrict new posts/comments, or do intros to alternative social media ex. Mastodon/Lemmy/Bluesky/etc., or create a general social/chat thread ...).

I have a new colleague who has a “masters in cybersecurity” (and no experience) who I’m trying to mentor. Last week, I came across a website that had the same name as our domain but with a different TLD. It used our logo and some copy of header info from our main website. We didn’t immediately know if it was fraud, brand abuse, or if one of our offices in another country set it up for some reason (shadow IT). I invited my new colleague to join me in investigating the website… I shared the link and asked, “We found a website using our brand but we know nothing about it, how can we determine if this is shadow IT or fraud?”  After a minute his reply was, “I tried my email and password but it didn’t accept it. Then I tried my admin account and it also was not accepted. Is it broken?” 😮",1691406934.0,everyone complains cant get good job cybersecurity degree new colleague master cybersecurity experience im trying mentor last week came across website name domain different tld used logo copy header info main website didnt immediately know fraud brand abuse one office another country set reason shadow invited new colleague join investigating website shared link asked found website using brand know nothing determine shadow fraud minute reply tried email password didnt accept tried admin account also accepted broken,-0.3911,Negative

* **ELI5: x86\_64 Exploit Development Fundamentals w/ John Ryan & Adrian Abdala (2-Hours)** \- Wed, Oct 14, 2020 12:30 PM - 3:00 PM EDT - Do the phrases “exploit development” or “buffer overflow” intimidate you? Maybe you’ve only heard the words, but they sound too advanced to learn. Maybe you performed one or two buffer overflows while pursuing a certification, but you still don’t quite understand the underlying mechanics of compiled software exploitation. In this 2-hour workshop-style webcast, we’re going to dive into key concepts of computer organization to learn how x86\_64 Linux software journeys from C source code to become a functional program in computer memory – ready to be exploited.

"Whoops, got someone arrested!",https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/17wzf04/whoops_got_someone_arrested/,"This happened today:

I get a call from the Service Desk saying that they got a request from ""a pen tester"" to disable Dot1x port security in one of our offices. They were apparently unable to get past it and wanted someone to open the ports so the could do further testing.

I look through my emails / messages / notes and can find no reference of anyone performing a physical penetration test. I ping the entire Cyber Security team (3 people and their director), none of them respond immediately via email / teams / text.

I call the building security, who aren't employees but provide security for the entire office building that houses 5 or 6 companies in total. I tell them we potentially have an unauthorized person on one of our floors, could they please go remove them and ask them to wait in the lobby.

Apparently building security just called the police for some reason. The response was quick because the police station is literally across the street from our office building. They went in and arrested the dude.

He's been since released and I'm not sure how long he was actually detained. We have a meeting with myself, my director, the Cybersecurity directory and our corporate lawyer tomorrow to gather facts.

This will be fun.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\* Update \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It was a legitimate pen test during business hours. Security team just didn't inform me (the only Network Engineer at my company) as they didn't think I'd need to know except to act on whatever remediations needed to be done afterwards.

Even though it was business hours, the floor was empty due to 95% of the company working from home. The pen-tester called the Service Desk, they got the number from a sign that is posted in a meeting room ""for help call service desk at xxx"".

The pen-tester was ""soft arrested"", basically just escorted back to the police station across the street while the PD vetted the guy's story, which did check out.

No harm, no foul I suppose. 

Cybersecurity director called out that I did what was expected. It was not expected that the pen-tester would ever engage with me.

I can tell the pen-tester is back at it because just got alerts that my APs detected someone trying to spoof our SSID.",1700173722.0,happened today get call service desk saying got request pen tester disable dotx port security one office apparently unable get past wanted someone open port could testing look email message note find reference anyone performing physical penetration test ping entire cyber security team people director none respond immediately via email team text call building security arent employee provide security entire office building house company total tell potentially unauthorized person one floor could please go remove ask wait lobby apparently building security called police reason response quick police station literally across street office building went arrested dude he since released im sure long actually detained meeting director cybersecurity directory corporate lawyer tomorrow gather fact fun xb xb update legitimate pen test business hour security team didnt inform network engineer company didnt think id need know except act whatever remediation needed done afterwards even though business hour floor empty due company working home pentester called service desk got number sign posted meeting room help call service desk xxx pentester soft arrested basically escorted back police station across street pd vetted guy story check harm foul suppose cybersecurity director called expected expected pentester would ever engage tell pentester back got alert aps detected someone trying spoof ssid,0.9153,Positive

F*ck Cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/12aumfx/fck_cybersecurity/,"Let me reiterate. F\*ck the bureaucratic process of cybersecurity jobs.

I had so much fun learning how networking works. How packets are sent across the networks. Different types of protocols. Different types of tools to detect attackers. Different methods to attack systems.

But now, I am at a point where I am just questioning myself...

Why the fck am I begging to protect someone's asset that I don't even care about as if it were some kind of blessing from the skies?

10 years of experience required. A security clearance. Unrealistic expectations. Extensive experience in 300 tools. Just for what? Sitting on your computer reading log files and clearing useless alerts (not all positions, I get it).

Like, c'mon.

I am starting to think that there is no point in the ""mission"" of safeguarding these assets. With these unrealistic expectations, it's almost as if they don't want them to be safeguarded at first place.

You know what? Let the breaches occur. I don't care anymore, lol.

Threat actors are living the life. Actually using the skills they are learning to their own monetary benefits, as opposed to us ""cybersecurity professionals"", who have to beg the big boss for a paycheck and show that we are worthy at first place to be even considered for the so glorious position of protecting someone's money making assets.",1680549452.0,let reiterate fck bureaucratic process cybersecurity job much fun learning networking work packet sent across network different type protocol different type tool detect attacker different method attack system point questioning fck begging protect someone asset dont even care kind blessing sky year experience required security clearance unrealistic expectation extensive experience tool sitting computer reading log file clearing useless alert position get like cmon starting think point mission safeguarding asset unrealistic expectation almost dont want safeguarded first place know let breach occur dont care anymore lol threat actor living life actually using skill learning monetary benefit opposed u cybersecurity professional beg big bos paycheck show worthy first place even considered glorious position protecting someone money making asset,0.8536,Positive
Confessions of a cyber security hiring manager,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/rc31oa/confessions_of_a_cyber_security_hiring_manager/,"EDIT: There seems to be a huge disconnect between hiring managers and potential candidates. This post is meant to shed light on why you might not be getting jobs. If you're a hiring manager and have a different experience, throw it in the comments, shed some light on it. If you're a candidate and salty that this is how it works in most places, air your grievances below... 

I've hired approximately 25 people into various cyber security roles recently. Primarily, entry level SOC Analysts, Penetration Testers and Risk Analysts. 

Every entry level (and senior) role I advertise, gets maybe 75 - 100 applicants. 

30% of these applicants have 0 cyber experience, 0 certifications and a cover letter that says basically ""cyber security pays well, give me a job."" 

30% of these applicants have a degree in cyber security and/or Security+ and one or two other certs. But no IT experience and no cyber security experience. They are usually grads / young. 

30% of these applicants have a security+ certificate and 10+ years of experience in management/accounting/lawyering/Consulting. But now want to make a change into cyber security. They know how to handle tough stakeholders, project manage, communicate, etc. 

5% of these applicants are the ones you have to sift through. They have 3 or 4 years experience as a IT helpdesk/sysadmin/netadmin or developer. They have 100s of hours on Hack the box. They have spoken at a local security conference on a basic topic, but one they know inside out. They have a degree and/or Security+ and/or Azure/AWS cloud experience. They are really passionate about cyber security and you can see they spend all their spare time doing it. Some of my team will know them (cyber security is a small industry) and red flag them as ""they're hard to work with"" or ""they made racist comments at a bar during a conference"". Some will be flagged as ""seems nice"" or ""helped me once with a CTF"". 

Then you've got the final 5% of the applicants, they have the same as the above BUT they went to uni with one of my existing team, or my existing team know them through CTFs/conferences/discord, etc. My team vouches for them and says they're hard working. 

I know people will respond and say ""but i don't have time to do 100s of hours of hack the box"". I get that. I'm not saying you have to. I'm saying this is what you're competing against. 

As a hiring manager, I'll always hire guys who are passionate about cyber security. It'd be a disservice to me and my team to not hire the best and make us cover for them. 

I know some will say ""you can't just hire people's friends"". Sadly this is how most of the industry works. It's because cyber security people are used to dealing with and reducing risk. Hiring someone my team has worked with (over months) and likes is less risk than hiring someone after two or three hour long interviews. Good people know good people. So if you're team is good, hiring people they think are good is a win. 

What's the outcomes of this post? 

Well, if you're struggling to get a job with just a security+ or a degree, know what you're up against. I fully believe that you will find a job but you'll need to apply on 50 - 100, or even 100s. You'll need to find that role that doesn't get applied on by the person doing hours of hack the box and such in their spare time. 

Additionally, if you're struggling to get a role. Make friends! Network! Go to industry events, jump on LinkedIn, etc. Be the person in uni who turns up to all the classes and meets people. Don't be the asshole who does no work in group projects.

I see quite a few people on here getting a Security+ and then claiming they can't find a job anywhere and there's no shortage. I've hired people with just Security+ or base level knowledge before. It's months before they get to be useful. During that time, theyre having to shadow a senior and take up that seniors already precious time. My seniors all already have a junior or three each that they are training. This industry is starved for seniors. I see the difference between a junior and a senior as, can you operate mostly independently? For example, if i give you a case that an exec has opened a malicious .html file attached to an email, can you run with it? Can you deobfuscate the JS, discover IOCs and can you load those IOCs into some of my security tools? Are you good with Splunk, Palo Alto, Fortinet or Crowdstrike? Can you chat to the exec about this? Can you search all other mailboxes for more emails and delete them? Can you check sentinel for proxy logs and see who else may have clicked them? All of these skills are the shortage we are experiencing. I don't expect anyone to know all these. You'll still probably have to ping a colleague on if theyve discovered any great deobfuscation tools or the exact query to search O365 mailboxes. But I don't have seniors to give you an intro to Splunk, Palo, Sentinel, whatever. Therefore, if you can get some training and experience with tools and actually put them to use, you'll find yourself much closer to being a senior and standing out amongst candidates. 

Ideas

Setup an instance of Splunk, setup a Windows VM and some security tools, onboard it's logs to Splunk, download some malware (Google ""GitHub malware samples""), run this on your windows VM and write queries/alerts/etc to identify it. OR buy a cheap Fortinet firewall model, setup it up at home for you and family, setup rules, block all ad domains, set the IPS to alert on everything, tune the signatures, setup a VPN for when you're out and about OR do hack the box and learn practical offensive security knowledge.

I am the Chief Technology Officer at Akamai and I’ve spent the last 20+ years solving the internet’s toughest challenges. AMA!,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/u8pgcc/i_am_the_chief_technology_officer_at_akamai_and/,"Hi Reddit! I’m Dr. Robert Blumofe ([u/RobertBlumofe](https://www.reddit.com/u/robertblumofe)) Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at Akamai ([u/akamai\_technologies](https://www.reddit.com/user/akamai_technologies)), former UT Professor, and MIT and Brown University graduate. But most people call me Bobby. This is my first AMA and I’d be happy to take you behind the curtain of what we do at Akamai, how I started my career, how a kid growing up in a show- biz family became a nerd, or even my hobbies (I’m a juggler, water-skier, former pilot, and novice musician).

[Proof](https://imgur.com/a/VNFkmFh)

If you’re not familiar, Akamai powers and protects life online. Global companies trust us to deliver and secure digital experiences — helping billions to live, work, and play online. With the world’s largest and most trusted edge platform, Akamai keeps apps, code, and experiences closer to users — and threats farther away.

I’ve been at Akamai since 1999 and previously I’ve been responsible for developing and operating the distributed system underlying all Akamai products and services. Today, I lead Akamai’s technology strategy and represent Akamai’s technology vision in the marketplace.

Ask me about Zero Trust, why I hate that moniker, why I think that all access should be remote access, and why I think there is no such thing as a secure network. And on a personal level, how to do a three-ball cascade, my favorite drummers, growing up in Beverly Hills, or anything about my grandfather, comedian Jack Benny!

Phishing Attacks - Underestimated effect of Internationalised domain names,https://www.certic.info/images/cyrilicattack.jpeg,,1719909827.0,nan,0.0,Neutral
Just received an advanced vishing attack,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/15mndn3/just_received_an_advanced_vishing_attack/,"Created a throwaway to post this.

I just received a call from my sister's contact name and actual phone number; she lives across the country from me. A man was on the other end, sounding crazed and immediately threatening my sister's well-being and life. He said that he had kidnapped her, beat her, and would r\*pe and kill her if I didn't open Cash App and send him money that he requested.

So, a few things at this point:

* The call is coming directly from my sister's number. It's connected to her contact card in my phone. It's NOT a generic number. 
* This guy knows my name, and my sister's.
* He knows my cashapp handle and has already made a payment request to the handle from a generic looking account (created less than 1 week ago).
* He's extremely agitated and continuing the threats above.

I was able to stall for a bit, because I sincerely had to redownload CashApp onto my phone. As I'm stalling, I'm asking him for proof of wellbeing, proof of life, and to hear my sister's voice. Some muffled screams in the background sounded like my sister, but nothing was said that clearly identified her.

I continued to try to do my best Voss on this guy, telling him that I won't be able to make a payment if he can't guarantee my sister's well being, and did a little more stalling as I was loading cash into the app (again, still not knowing whether this was a real situation or not). At about 12 minutes in, he hangs up. I immediately call my sister's number back, and to my relief, I hear her voice.

I immediately ask her to FaceTime me, and she's just sitting in her car -- safe and sound.

My question here is: has anyone experienced anything similar? I've been in the cybersecurity field for several years from a security awareness and user training standpoint, consider myself well-versed in attacks like these, and this is like nothing I've ever seen, heard about, or experienced directly.

This is a bit of a vent, a question, and a warning in case others experience similar attacks in the coming days or weeks. Stay safe out there.

EDIT: thanks for all of the advice, sharing of similar stories, articles, and well-wishes here. I’m at work but will try to most of the replies individually today.

Latest SSN data breach,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1eyckbl/latest_ssn_data_breach/,"This is getting ridiculous. As an ex-military with many years of DoD contractor service, this breach has literally exposed EVERYTHING. From what I understand, if you've ever worked for the DoD, this is basically what goes into your SF-86/E-QIP. I looked at my latest clearance renewal (TS/SCI) and my marriages (don't judge), every placed I've ever lived, all my friends, and many other things have been found... all unencrypted by ""National Public Data"" (clearinghouse for all things ""clearance"" related.

The thing that pisses me off more than anything is these asshats are going to negotiate 24 months of ""credit monitoring"" when I already have it for umpteen other breaches, including the OPM breach from years back that exposed personal data of myself and all my family members.

As an information security architect for a major medical device provider, it is seriously not difficult to protect this information. To think that someone who processes government security clearances as a business model literally had billions of peoples' PII stored unencrypted (and the US gov still did business with them), leading to this breach, could get away with just providing ""free credit monitoring"" makes me fucking sick. These fucks should have to pay cold hard cash to everyone affected, until there is no money left to pay out and they go bankrupt. This should be the ""model"" for all breaches... not this free credit monitoring bullshit.

- Software Vulnerabilities
- Networking
- Network Traffic Analysis 
- Crypto Labs
- Web Security
- System Security and Operations 
- Industrial Control System Security 

These are provided by the Naval Postgraduate School Center for Cybersecurity and Cyber Operations.

I have worked through several of these labs and the lab manuals do a good job of making you figure out the solution for yourself. They provide questions that typically require you to do additional research into the topic and really help in focusing your efforts into learning the important things.

I hope someone can find these useful as I believe it’s a great free resource for getting introduced into the mentioned categories.

I made a post asking for some free resources so I can add them to this [cybersecurity page](https://hero.page/cybersecurity), and I got so many links, and went down so many rabbit holes, that I've built a pretty good resource for myself (and hopefully for others)! I also had a few other redditors helping me build these spaces too, and for that I am *extremely* grateful.

My goal was too make a no-fuss place where you can access free stuff.. no ads or sign up modals on every page, I hope you find it useful too!

Here are some of the dedicated spaces for which resources have been added (Lots of PDF's):

Vault 7 Megathread - Technical Analysis & Commentary of the CIA Hacking Tools Leak,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/5y1pag/vault_7_megathread_technical_analysis_commentary/,"##### Overview

I know that a lot of you are coming here looking for submissions related to the [Vault 7 leak](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=nws&q=vault+7&*). We've also been flooded with submissions of varying quality focused on the topic.
  
Rather than filter through tons of submissions that split the discussion across disparate threads, we are opening this thread for any technical analysis or discussion of the leak.

##### Guidelines
  
The usual content and discussion guidelines apply; please keep it technical and objective, without editorializing or making claims that the data doesn't support (e.g. researching a capability does not imply that such a capability exists). Use an original source wherever possible. Screenshots are fine as a safeguard against surreptitious editing, but link to the source document as well.

**Please report comments that violate these guidelines or contain personal information.** 
  
##### If you have or are seeking a .gov security clearance

The US Government considers leaked information with classification markings as classified until they say otherwise, and viewing the documents could jeopardize your clearance. Best to wait until [CNN reports on it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/10/17/remember-its-illegal-to-possess-wikileaks-clinton-emails-but-its-different-for-the-media-says-cnns-chris-cuomo/).
